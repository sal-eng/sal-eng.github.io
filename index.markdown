## About Me

Hi, I'm **Muhammad Saleh Anwar**, an AI Lead and Researcher with over a decade of experience bridging engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence. I am currently pursuing my PhD in AI and Engineering Mathematics at Dalhousie University.

My work is centered on a unique challenge: developing and deploying secure, reliable, and compliant AI in high-stakes industrial environments. I combine expertise in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems with deep, hands-on experience in the nuclear power sector from my time at Ontario Power Generation (OPG). My mission is to drive innovation and operational excellence by architecting AI solutions that meet the stringent demands of safety-critical industries.

This portfolio highlights my work at the intersection of advanced AI and critical infrastructure.

### Current Research Focus: Secure and Compliant AI for Critical Domains

My PhD research is focused on a foundational challenge: creating Large Language Models (LLMs) that can safely and reliably operate within complex, high-stakes industries. The objective is to build a generalized framework for developing, training, and deploying highly specialized LLMs that deliver exceptional performance where accuracy and security are paramount. While my primary case study is the nuclear power sector, the principles and pipelines are designed for any regulated, safety-critical environment.

#### Key Research Pillars:

* **Synthetic Data Generation for Data Scarcity:** A primary hurdle in many specialized domains is the lack of public, structured training data. My research develops methods to transform unstructured, domain-specific documents (e.g., engineering manuals, legal contracts, technical reports) into high-quality question-answer pairs, creating robust datasets for fine-tuning LLMs.

* **Advanced Information Extraction from Complex Documents:** Technical documentation in critical fields is not just text; it contains vital information locked in complex structures. This pillar focuses on developing techniques to extract and leverage data from multi-modal sources, including tables (e.g., operational limits), forms (e.g., compliance reports), and schematics. This structured information is crucial for building a comprehensive knowledge base for LLM training.

* **Secure & Private Domain-Specific LLM Development:** I am building scalable pipelines to train compact yet powerful, domain-specific LLMs on private, air-gapped hardware. This approach is designed to meet the stringent cybersecurity and data confidentiality requirements of regulated sectors, such as nuclear energy, finance, or healthcare, while producing models that excel at understanding nuanced, specialized terminology.

* **Controllable AI via Multi-Agent Systems:** To guarantee reliability, I am designing a "Safety-Verifier Agent" within a multi-agent architecture. This system acts as an oversight mechanism, ensuring AI-generated outputs are fact-checked and reliable, and that a human operator is always in the loop. This aligns with human-centered design principles essential for any high-reliability organization.

* **Integrated Regulatory Assurance:** The entire framework synthesizes AI security, data generation, and system control into a cohesive solution. The final output is a complete process designed from the ground up to meet the rigorous demands of regulatory review and compliance in any high-assurance environment.
